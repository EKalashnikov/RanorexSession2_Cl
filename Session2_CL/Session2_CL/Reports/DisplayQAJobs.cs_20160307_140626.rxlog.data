				Item 'Session2_CLRepository.WebDocumentIE.sectionPost' could be found using its absolute path, but not using its relative path from the cached element of parent folder 'Session2_CLRepository.WebDocumentIE'. This can happen if either the item search timeout is too small or if items within a rooted folder do not share a common parent element. To fix this problem, first increase the item search timeout. If this does not help, create a separate rooted folder for this item or disable caching for the specified folder.
