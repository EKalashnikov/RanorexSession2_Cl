							http://miami.craigslist.org/pbc/sof/5490571225.html : requirements: Knowledge with XML, XSLT (specifically XSL 1.0), some design- and HTML/CSS skills oriented towards mobile. Ability to work independently.
Project 2: Back-end club editor
We have a website powered by Apache, PHP and MySQL. We have a back-end framework which is driven by JavaScript and communicates with the server using XHR with any language capable of producing XML. At the moment we are using PHP, perl and compiled C/C++ but adding Ruby, Java or JavaScript via nodejs would not be a problem.
What we need is an experienced developer to create tools for us such as location management (a location is a club or restaurant or similar, with entries in the database). A PSD comp or two can be provided if necessary, there are also several existing tools/applications already integrated in the back-end for reference. The JavaScript used should be as free from external dependencies as possible, ie. not reliant on jQuery, Angular or anything similar. For this particular tool (location management), we see the server-side script/program mostly used as a transport for the database information, so nothing complex.
We expect the developer to work independently as much as possible but we will provide resources and short Q&amp;A-sessions if required.
Developer requirements: Knowledge in JavaScript for web applications, as well as one or more server-side languages for communication purposes. Some UI design skills. Ability to work independently.
